## Background Context
### Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

#### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the **AirBnB clone**.
This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following
projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

- put in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization
of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`…) that inherit from `BaseModel`
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
